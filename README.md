# pronunciation_translator
Repository for my pronunciation translator (from ENG to PT-BR).

This project aims to aid new english learners to get familiar with pronunciations.

Just as google provides the pronunciation for each word requested, this program allows to input several words and get their pronunciation

It should simplify the understanding of the pronunciation alphabet (IAP - International Phonetic Alphabet).
A prototype of the program was done on Excel using VBA, and is show below:
